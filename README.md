Ida's Esteem Engine
===================

"You forget your victories, but you remember the losses."

This little application serves up personal affirmations and lost memories of victory. It's handy for when I've forgotten what I'm worth.

The original version of this project was made for my partner. He missed me terribly during a few months of long distance, so I made something to remind him that I love him. It feels great to make a version for myself.
